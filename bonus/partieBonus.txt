Mandatory part

This project will consist of setting up several environments under specific rules.

It is divided into three parts you have to do in the following order:

• Part 1: K3s and Vagrant
• Part 2: K3s and three simple applications
• Part 3: K3d and Argo CD

Chapter V
Bonus part

The following extra is intended to be useful: add Gitlab in the lab you did in Part 3.
    
    Beware this bonus is complex. The latest version available of Gitlab
    from the official website is expected.

    You are allowed to use whatever you need to achieve this extra. For example, helm
could be useful here.

    • Your Gitlab instance must run locally.
    • Configure Gitlab to make it work with your cluster.
    • Create a dedicated namespace named gitlab.
    • Everything you did in Part 3 must work with your local Gitlab.

    Turn this extra work in a new folder named bonus and located at the root of your
repository. You can add everything needed so your entire cluster works.

    The bonus part will only be assessed if the mandatory part is
    PERFECT. Perfect means the mandatory part has been integrally done
    and works without malfunctioning. If you have not passed ALL the
    mandatory requirements, your bonus part will not be evaluated at all.

Chapter VI
Submission and peer-evaluation

    Turn in your assignment in your Git repository as usual. 
Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense.
Don’t hesitate to double check the names of
your folders and files to ensure they are correct.

    Reminder:

        • Turn the mandatory part in three folders located at the root of your repository:
            p1, p2 and p3.
        • Optional: Turn the bonus part in a located at the root of your repository:
            bonus.

    Any scripts you need will be added in a scripts folder. The
    configuration files will be in a confs folder.

    The evaluation process will happen on the computer of the evaluated
    group.
